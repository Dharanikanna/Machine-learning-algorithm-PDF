‚ÄúMachine Learning is the science of getting computers to learn and act like humans do, and improve their learning over time in autonomous fashion, by feeding them data and information in the form of observations and real-world interactions.‚Äù

### Supervised machine learning            
Supervised machine learning trains itself on a labeled data set. That is, the data is labeled with information that the machine learning model is being built to determine and that may even be classified in ways the model is supposed to classify data. For example, a computer vision model designed to identify purebred German Shepherd dogs might be trained on a data set of various labeled dog images.  

### Unsupervised machine learning
Unsupervised machine learning ingests unlabeled data‚Äîlots and lots of it‚Äîand uses algorithms to extract meaningful features needed to label, sort, and classify the data in real-time, without human intervention. Unsupervised learning is less about automating decisions and predictions, and more about identifying patterns and relationships in data that humans would miss. Take spam detection, for example‚Äîpeople generate more email than a team of data scientists could ever hope to label or classify in their lifetimes. An unsupervised learning algorithm can analyze huge volumes of emails and uncover the features and patterns that indicate spam (and keep getting better at flagging spam over time).

### Semi-supervised learning 
Semi-supervised learning offers a happy medium between supervised and unsupervised learning. During training, it uses a smaller labeled data set to guide classification and feature extraction from a larger, unlabeled data set. Semi-supervised learning can solve the problem of having not enough labeled data (or not being able to afford to label enough data) to train a supervised learning algorithm. 

### Reinforcement machine learning
Reinforcement machine learning is a behavioral machine learning model that is similar to supervised learning, but the algorithm isn‚Äôt trained using sample data. This model learns as it goes by using trial and error. A sequence of successful outcomes will be reinforced to develop the best recommendation or policy for a given problem.
