‚ÄúMachine Learning is the science of getting computers to learn and act like humans do, and improve their learning over time in autonomous fashion, by feeding them data and information in the form of observations and real-world interactions.‚Äù

### Supervised machine learning            
Supervised machine learning trains itself on a labeled data set. That is, the data is labeled with information that the machine learning model is being built to determine and that may even be classified in ways the model is supposed to classify data. For example, a computer vision model designed to identify purebred German Shepherd dogs might be trained on a data set of various labeled dog images.  

### Unsupervised machine learning
Unsupervised machine learning ingests unlabeled data‚Äîlots and lots of it‚Äîand uses algorithms to extract meaningful features needed to label, sort, and classify the data in real-time, without human intervention. Unsupervised learning is less about automating decisions and predictions, and more about identifying patterns and relationships in data that humans would miss. Take spam detection, for example‚Äîpeople generate more email than a team of data scientists could ever hope to label or classify in their lifetimes. An unsupervised learning algorithm can analyze huge volumes of emails and uncover the features and patterns that indicate spam (and keep getting better at flagging spam over time).

### Semi-supervised learning 
Semi-supervised learning offers a happy medium between supervised and unsupervised learning. During training, it uses a smaller labeled data set to guide classification and feature extraction from a larger, unlabeled data set. Semi-supervised learning can solve the problem of having not enough labeled data (or not being able to afford to label enough data) to train a supervised learning algorithm. 

### Reinforcement machine learning
Reinforcement machine learning is a behavioral machine learning model that is similar to supervised learning, but the algorithm isn‚Äôt trained using sample data. This model learns as it goes by using trial and error. A sequence of successful outcomes will be reinforced to develop the best recommendation or policy for a given problem.

If the algorithm is too simple (hypothesis with linear eq.) then it may be on high bias and low variance condition and thus is error-prone. If algorithms fit too complex ( hypothesis with high degree eq.) then it may be on high variance and low bias. In the latter condition, the new entries will not perform well. Well, there is something between both of these conditions, known as Trade-off or Bias Variance Trade-off.

* [Cross-Validation](https://github.com/piyushpathak03/Machine-learning-algorithm-PDF/tree/main/Cross%20Validation)

Cross validation is a model evaluation method that is better than residuals. The problem with residual evaluations is that they do not give an indication of how well the learner will do when it is asked to make new predictions for data it has not already seen. One way to overcome this problem is to not use the entire data set when training a learner. Some of the data is removed before training begins. Then when training is done, the data that was removed can be used to test the performance of the learned model on new data. This is the basic idea for a whole class of model evaluation methods called cross validation.
